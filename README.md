# Testament System
## Description
This school project is focused on developing a web-based tool for visualizing and managing inheritance distributions. The system enables users to map family structures, list assets, and simulate inheritance scenarios through an intuitive interface. Developed collaboratively with a Product Owner, this project is designed to mimic real-world development workflows, incorporating regular feedback and requirement adjustments.   

#### Objectives
* User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive user experience to accommodate a broad range of users.    
* Visual Representation: Provide tools for users to visualize family trees and assets, giving a comprehensive view of inheritance planning.    
* Simulation: Enable users to simulate different inheritance scenarios based on legal structures and personal preferences.    
* Data Export: Allow data export for collaboration with legal professionals, facilitating the inheritance planning process.    

### Functions
* Family Tree Visualization: Users can create and visualize their family tree structure to understand potential inheritance distributions.    
* Asset Visualization: Input and visualize assets (e.g., properties, vehicles), giving users a complete overview of their estate.    
* Inheritance Distribution Simulation: Simulate how assets will be distributed among beneficiaries based on different scenarios, allowing users to explore various outcomes dynamically.    
* Data Export: Generate exportable data formats to share with legal professionals, easing the transfer of essential information for finalizing inheritance plans.
